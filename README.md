## Project Description
### Predicting the final sale price at fine art auctions
+++++++++++++++++\
\
**Overview:**\
With data retrieved from an art database create a model that would be capable of utilizing the numeric data to predict the price of 10 artists
sale prices. \
**Method**\
Regression / Classification / Deep Learning (Image Recognition).\
**Takeaways**\
TBD.\
**Skills:**\
Tensor Flow, Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Pandas, EDA, Facebook, SciKit-Learn, Classification

## Project Goals
---
- Accurately predicting an auction house estimate price for the art of 10 artist of which are the highest grossing/ highest volume within the market

## Initial Thoughts
--- 
- The artist will likely be the strongest drivers of the price point. The disparity of sale price for some artists is much higher meanwhile some will float within the same range.
- When incorporating image recognition the neural network will likely be able to recognize the works of the 10 artists, due to all of them being regarded for their individual styles.

## Planning
--- 
1. Acquire data from artnet.com
2. Data could only be retrieved in the form of a PDF
3. Clean aforementioned PDF/PDFs
3. Explore and analyze data for better insights on relative context to artist and their prices\
    a. Determine our baseline prediction\
    b. Are we beating the auction house's estimates?\
    c. Does logarithmically transforming hammer price allow for easier scaling for models?
    d. Stats test high frequency words to artists\ 
4. Start with Regression Model
5. Proceed to Classification
6. Document conclusions, recommendations, and next steps 
7. Move forward to MLP (Multilayer Percepitron) OR CNN (Convultional Neural Network)
